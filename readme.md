Animated SID music file player for my tune "Endstation" - music for the end part of the BCC#10 demo party entry of the Fantastic 4 Cracking Group: "From Berlin to Paris and back".  

It was one of my first C64-programs after a very long time after my childhood. This time (2015) I used "CBM PRG Studio" a unique all in one C64 assembler, charset-, sprite-editor and there is much more to it: https://www.ajordison.co.uk/

You can see a video of the program here:
